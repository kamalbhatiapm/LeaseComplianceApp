## Kill Criteria (from SPEC §11)

Stop the GA clock if any of these thresholds are hit during beta:

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Beta auditor acceptance | <60% after BUG-006 ships | Pause GA; auditor validation study |
| IBR resolution rate post-J9 | <50% after 2 weeks | User interview — copy may not be the issue |
| AI accuracy on beta contracts | <90% on ≥10 contracts | Audit n8n pipeline |
| Activation at 30 days | <55% | Activation audit on upload → first report funnel |
| Webhook success rate | <99.5% over 7 days | P0 incident; no new features |
